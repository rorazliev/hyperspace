## About

**Hyperspace** is a single-player browser game designed in science fiction style. The game is written in plain JavaScript using Node.js toolchains such as Babel and Webpack.

## Gameplay

The player controls a spaceship that endlessly flies through a meteor shower. The goal of the game is to travel as long distances as possible, not smashing a meteor. Every passed meteor gives 10 game points, and every 100 points speed up the gameplay, making further progress harder.
